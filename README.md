## Product Analysis

Calculated the sales and profit for each category, sub category and product. Using this data we also calculated the top 5 products in terms of its profit markup in relation to total sale value.

We split the dataset into each year in order to analyse seasonal trends. Subsequently, we plotted the average discount of each 5 days in order to better visualise the data. In areas that had higher discounts, we found the dates and created an updated dataset that showed sales and profit before, during and after each discount period.

We analysed the profit on each product with and without discounts, in order to analyse how much effective profit was actually made, or if discounts incurred a loss of profit that was not recouped in terms of total sale.

## Customer Analysis

We calculated which customers generated the most profit for the company by separating the dataset into a unique set, and aggregating the profit figures.

We then looked at the profit for each customer with and without discounts. This shows us how much of an effect saving money via discount affects the users' likeliness to buy products.
